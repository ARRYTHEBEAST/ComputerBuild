// so after first glance this looks like a fancy and gate. imma check it out more.
// alright the carry has to be attached to a and gate and the sum has to be attached to a XOR gate. I 
think thats it.
CHIP HalfAdder {
    IN a, b;    // 1-bit inputs
    OUT sum,    // Right bit of a + b 
        carry;  // Left bit of a + b

    PARTS:
    And(a=a , b=b , out=carry );
    Xor(a =a , b =b , out = sum );
}

// yeah it works.
