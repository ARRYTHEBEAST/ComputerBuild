This is the repo which tracks my progress and serves as a place to store my notes that i make in my journey to make an entire computer by my self.:)

Right from NAND, to the entire computer architecture, assembler, my own assembly, my own OS, my own language to write stuff, my own compiler for that language. 

So yeah thats the plan.

I intend on learning from;

1. NAND2Tetris
2. fromthetransistor
3. And other various resources online
