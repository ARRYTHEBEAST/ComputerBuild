// Alright i think i should revise what a DMux is first (@ _ @)
// I think i should be able to directlu use the previosu approach here.
// Or maybe before doing that i will just reverse the solution to Mux4Way16 and just reverse it and try.
// LOL it just worked. yeah no shit lmao.

CHIP DMux4Way {
    IN in, sel[2];
    OUT a, b, c, d;

    PARTS:
    DMux(in=in , sel=sel[1] , a=ek , b=do );
    DMux(in=ek , sel=sel[0] , a=a , b=b );
    DMux(in=do , sel=sel[0] , a=c , b=d );
